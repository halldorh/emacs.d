;;; early-init.el --- Emacs 27+ pre-initialisation config

;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs 27+ loads this file before (normally) calling
;; `package-initialize'.  We use this file to suppress that automatic
;; behaviour so that startup is consistent across Emacs versions.

;;; Code:

(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
(with-eval-after-load 'package
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("nongnu" . "https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/")))

;; So we can detect this having been loaded
(provide 'early-init)

;;; early-init.el ends here
